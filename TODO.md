# TODO — scratchpad

The structured roadmap lives in **[VALIDATION_PLAN.md](VALIDATION_PLAN.md)**
(validation/benchmarking, §1–§6, tracked as issues #8–#12) and
**[FUTURE_WORK.md](FUTURE_WORK.md)** (expanding beyond GO to other ontologies).
This file is just loose notes.

## Done
- ~~Switch to pre-computed InterPro download~~ — `scripts/download_data.py`.
- ~~Download the InterPro→GO mapping~~ — `interpro2go` data source.
- ~~Validate results against InterPro2GO~~ — §1 (coverage reframe), ~65% at FDR<0.01.
- ~~Fix pipeline correctness~~ — contingency-table + True Path Rule bugs (#15, #17).

## Next (see VALIDATION_PLAN.md)
- **§2 temporal/CAFA benchmark** (#8) — the next real milestone.
- §3 compare to original dcGO — re-key on Pfam/SUPERFAMILY signatures (#9).

## Loose ideas / nice-to-haves
- Add InterPro names / gene names / GO term descriptions to the output TSVs
  (currently just IDs) — improves readability for downstream users.
- Protein → genome positions from Ensembl (for a genome-browser view).
- Build anomaly/analysis data dir (`BUILD NOMALY DATADIR` — original note).
- Other ontologies (DO/HPO/MP/EC/Reactome) — see FUTURE_WORK.md.
